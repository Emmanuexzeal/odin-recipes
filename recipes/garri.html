        <h2>Soaked Garri</h2>
        <p>Soaked Garri is seared cassava chips which is extremely well known in West Africa.Soaked Garri is normally eaten in 2 ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>As a cold beverage with ice cold water and sugar plus Checkers peanut</li>

            <li>As a grain which is made with tepid water, a few milk and sugar plus Checkers peanut

        </ol>

        <p>Historically, Garri was connected with poverty. It was occasionally referred to as "poor man's food".</p>

        <p>I'm not sure why, but I'm guessing it's because soaked Garri can double in size. Garri becomes more cost-effective in this manner.</p>


        <p>I'm not sure about it, but I do know we all enjoyed our soaked garri</p> 
                
        <p>Pro Tip: The best Garri to use for this soaking Garri'cereal' is Ijebu Garri.</p>
        <p>It's sour, therefore the sugar or sugar plus milk, depending on the scenario, gives it a delicious sweet and sour flavor.</p>
